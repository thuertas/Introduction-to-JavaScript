            <h3 class="title-font">Drawing</h3>
            <p>
                Is a form of visual art in which a person uses various drawing instruments to mark paper or 
                another two-dimensional medium. Instruments include graphite pencils, pen and ink, various kinds 
                of paints, inked brushes, colored pencils, crayons, charcoal, chalk, pastels, various kinds of 
                erasers, markers, styluses, and various metals (such as silverpoint). Digital drawing is the act 
                of using a computer to draw. Common methods of digital drawing include a stylus or finger on a 
                touchscreen device, stylus- or finger-to-touchpad, or in some cases, a mouse. There are many 
                digital art programs and devices.

                A drawing instrument releases a small amount of material onto a surface, leaving a visible mark. 
                The most common support for drawing is paper, although other materials, such as cardboard, wood, 
                plastic, leather, canvas, and board, may be used. Temporary drawings may be made on a blackboard 
                or whiteboard or indeed almost anything. The medium has been a popular and fundamental means of 
                public expression throughout human history. It is one of the simplest and most efficient means of 
                communicating visual ideas.[1] The wide availability of drawing instruments makes drawing one of 
                the most common artistic activities.
                <br>
                In addition to its more artistic forms, drawing is frequently used in commercial illustration, 
                animation, architecture, engineering and technical drawing. A quick, freehand drawing, usually 
                not intended as a finished work, is sometimes called a sketch. An artist who practices or works 
                in technical drawing may be called a drafter, draftsman or a draughtsman.

            <p>
                Portraits are effective and compelling when they tell us something about the person. A good 
                portrait is not just a visual representation of a person; it will also reveal something about 
                the essence of the person. What the portrait reveals may not be completely obvious - sometimes 
                it can be cleverly implied through a certain expression or pose, an included object, or the artist's 
                use of color. Sometimes the person in the portrait can become iconic, representing a wider group of 
                people from a specific period in time, who share something in common.

            <p>
                The human form, in all of its glorious architecture, is the theme of this collection of drawings. 
                Here, artists capture the body's articulate eloquence in works that display both male and female figure 
                studies. The nude subject is a powerful and inspiring muse, and artists interpret the human figure in a 
                myriad of settings, periods, and artistic techniques. These artworks would be magnificent in the natural 
                setting of the powder room or the boudoir.

            <h1 class="title-font">Comic</h1>
            <p>
                is a medium used to express narratives or other ideas through images, usually combined with text. It typically 
                takes the form of a sequence of panels of images. Textual devices such as speech balloons, captions, and 
                onomatopoeia can indicate dialogue, narration, sound effects, or other information. The size and arrangement 
                of panels contribute to narrative pacing. Cartooning and other forms of illustration are the most common 
                image-making means in comics; fumetti is a form which uses photographic images. Common forms include comic 
                strips, editorial and gag cartoons, and comic books. Since the late 20th century, bound volumes such as graphic 
                novels, comic albums, and tank≈çbon have become increasingly common, while online webcomics have proliferated in the 
                21st century with the growth of the Internet.
